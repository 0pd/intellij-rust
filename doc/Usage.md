# Usage

Please note that most of the features are missing at the moment.

* There is no cargo support, you have to use command line to build your
  project. You can start a shell from the IDE with `Alt-F12`.
* There is no intelligent completion. You can use `expand word` (`Alt-/` by
  default) to complete based on the words present in the file.
* Formatting support is very basic, so `reformat code` will not do what you
  want.


## Features

* `Go to definition` for local variables,
* `File structure`, aka imenu. `Ctrl-F12` and `Alt-7` by default,
* `Expand selection` bound to `Ctrl-w` by default.
* `Live templates` aka snippets (`Ctrl-j` by default).

## Editors

We also have guides for [Emacs](Emacs.md) and [Vim](Vim.md) users :)
