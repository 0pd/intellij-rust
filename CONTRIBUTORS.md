IntelliJ would never see support for a Rust without these great people: 

  * [Aleksey Kladov](https://github.com/matklad)
  * [Alexey Kudinkin](https://github.com/alexeykudinkin)
  * [Evgeny Kurbatsky](https://github.com/atsky)
  * [Nikita Ofitserov](https://github.com/himikof)
  * [Tobias Bieniek](https://github.com/Turbo87)
  * [Vladislav Isenbaev](https://github.com/winger)

*We're keenly sorry if we've missed your name on this list, please email us to get it fixed.*

Other people have also helped in different ways: reporting bugs, requesting features, commenting, and by merely asking very reasonable questions.

Many thanks to all of you!
